# 🧪 Testbucket
Welcome to **Testbucket** an unpolished collection of test snippets, half-baked ideas, and “what happens if I try *this*?” experiments.

This repo exists primarily as a **playground for my own component tinkering**, breaking things, fixing them again, and occasionally learning something useful along the way. At the same time, it’s intentionally open: if you’re curious, learning to build, or just want to poke around and remix, you’re very welcome here.

Think of it as:
- a sketchbook rather than a finished product  
- a lab bench, not a showroom  
- a place where experiments are allowed to fail  

This should also help novice e-prototyping **industrial design students**, creative technologists, or anyone learning to build with code and hardware.

> Use freely, break responsibly, and don’t expect things to be tidy.
