Type 1:
**[Pimoroni RGB Encoder Breakout](https://opencircuit.nl/product/breakout-rgb-encoder)**
This Encoder has no direct pins exposed but is controlled over an on board Nuvoton MS51 microcontroller that handles both the encoder and the led. You can communicate with this microcontroller over I²C.
* In Arduino, you'll need the [IOExpander Library](https://github.com/ZodiusInfuser/IOExpander_Library)
